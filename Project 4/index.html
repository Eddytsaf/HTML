   <p> Hi there everyone. My name is jon-arbuckle. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am the proud owner of the cat name <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog name <strong>Odie</strong> Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain.</p> 
   Although my pets drive me <em>crazy</em>, I can imagine live without them. 
<br>
<p>I spent about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marirana sauce, frozen pizzas, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasagna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bags before i even have time to put in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that i bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <em>I was'nt too happy about that.</em>  </p>
